# Uptime monitor CLI
This is the CLI companion for [uptime-monitor](https://github.com/NietThijmen/Uptime-Monitor)

This just allows you to send your system info like CPU, RAM and disk usage to the uptime-monitor server.

To be fair, alot can be changed as this is literally my first rust project. I'm sure there are alot of things that can be improved.
